Requirements:
  Mintor uses RtMidi¹ and QExtSerialPort².

Install of requirements:
  You can use requierement for your system or embedded them into libraries.

  If you choose to use your system packages or your own install, please to refer to the according section.

  To embed librairies, proceed as follow, in Minotor source directory:

$ cd libraries/qextserialport
$ git clone https://code.google.com/p/qextserialport ./

$ cd ../..
  
$ cd libraries/rtmidi
$ wget http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~gary/rtmidi/release/rtmidi-2.0.1.tar.gz
$ tar xvzf rtmidi-2.0.1.tar.gz --strip-components=1

  Now, you can open QtCreator and compile Minotor as usual.

Debian and derivatives (Ubuntu,Linux Mint):
  Minotor could use RtMidi 1.0.15³ as provided some (old) version but may need to be patched.

  Minotor could be used with the RtMidi backend you want but have been tested and developped with ALSA support only.
  If you want to use ALSA, you need to patch it this way:

$ cd /tmp
$ apt-get source rtmidi
$ cd rtmidi-1.0.15~ds0/
$ nano debian/rules
Here, change this line:
  CONFIGURE_FLAGS = --with-jack
into
  CONFIGURE_FLAGS = 
Save the file, then exit editor.
$ dpkg-buildpackage -b
$ sudo dpkg -i ../librtmidi*.deb

Note: you need to enable source (deb-src) in your debian repositories list
(/etc/apt/sources.list.d). If they were disabled, don't forget to update your
database (sudo apt-get update).
