Requirements:
  Minotor uses RtMidi¹, it have been developped using 1.0.15².
  Minotor could be used with the RtMidi backend you want but have been tested and developped with ALSA support only.

  Under Debian and derivatives, RtMidi package could not be used as well, you need to patch it this way:

$ cd /tmp
$ apt-get source rtmidi
$ cd rtmidi-1.0.15~ds0/
$ nano debian/rules
Here, change this line:
  CONFIGURE_FLAGS = --with-jack
into
  CONFIGURE_FLAGS = 
Save the file, then exit editor.
$ dpkg-buildpackage -b
$ sudo dpkg -i ../librtmidi*.deb

Note: you need to enable source (deb-src) in your debian repositories list
(/etc/apt/sources.list.d). If they were disabled, don't forget to update your
database (sudo apt-get update).
